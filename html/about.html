                    This definition is well suited to traditional actuarial business but fails to define modern actuarial science.
                    The latter lies at the intersection of mathematics, statistics, machine learning, computer science, finance and
                    other related fields such as physics. To price a risk you must first understand it. To understand it, you need a
                    simplified representation of the underlying stochastic phenomenon and thus, you need a <i>model</i>. Modern models
                    usually require excellent developer skills. A <i>modern</i> actuary has a unique skillset along with exceptional
                    analysis skills.

                    I seek to become the perfect hybrid between a <strong>developer</strong> and a <strong>research professional</strong>.
                    I want to deliver analytical solutions along with a modern and robust implementation.

                    I am usually interested by
                    <ul>
                        <li>meterological perils, natural catastrophes and their underlying models;</li>
                        <li>climate change and its consequences on natural catastrophes;</li>
                        <li>geomatics and spatial models because of their close connection to natural catastrophes and</li>
                        <li>anything related to computer science.</li>

                    I consider myself an expert of the R programming language. I am not a true wizard (for the reference, read
                    <a href="https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/Internal.html">.Internal() base function
                    help page</a>),  in the sense that I don't have a deep understanding of all its C foundations, but I still
                    know a lot on it. I have had the chance to develop several packages for it. Aside from R, I am mostly
                    interested by C++ and Julia. C++ is the language I use when I need to implement fast algorithms and/or fast
                    programs. Julia is the future of R and should be considered in future modelling projects, especially when
                    starting from scratch. I have working knowledge on various web tools, but I am definitely not a web developer,
                    nor a front-end developer.
