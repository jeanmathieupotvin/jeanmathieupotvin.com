# Actuary (_ac-tu-ar-y_)

A person who compiles and analyzes statistics and uses them to calculate
insurance risks and premiums
[(Oxford Dictionary)](https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/actuary).

The modern actuarial science lies at the intersection of mathematics, statistics,
machine learning, computer science, finance and other related fields such as
physics. To price a risk you must first understand it. To understand it, you need
a simplified representation of the underlying stochastic phenomenon and thus, you
need a _model_. Modern models usually require excellent developer skills.

# My end-goal

I seek to become the perfect hybrid between a **developer** and a
**research professional**. I want to deliver analytical solutions along with a
modern and robust implementation.

# My work

In my work, I am (usually) mostly interested by

* natural catastrophes and their underlying models;
* climate change and its consequences on natural catastrophes;
* meterological perils;
* spatial models because of their close connection to natural catastrophes;
* geomatics algorithms and
* (almost) anything related to computer science.

**I consider myself an expert of the `R` programming language.** I am not a true
wizard (for the reference, read `base::.Internal()` [function help page](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/Internal.html)), 
in the sense that I don't have a deep understanding of all its `C` foundations,
but I still know a lot on it. I have had the chance to develop several packages
for it.

Aside from `R`, I am mostly interested by `C++` (and its `R` integration
through `Rcpp` packages), `Julia` and `Go`. `C++` is the language I use when I
need to implement fast algorithms and/or fast programs. `Julia` is the future of
`R` and should be considered in future modelling projects, especially when
starting from scratch. `Go` is a strong language that I more recently discovered
through `Hugo`, the webite generator built in `Golang`. I would like to use it in
the future.

I have working knowledge on various web tools, but I am definitely **not** a web
developer.
