My personal website source code

This repository contains the source code of my personal website: [jeanmathieupotvin.com](https://jeanmathieupotvin.com). The website
itself is pretty basic and is mostly inspired from the [Goa](https://github.com/shenoybr/hugo-goa) Hugo theme, but completely rewritten using only [W3.CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/) and other pure HTML/CSS functionalities. I got tired of being limited by some functionalities of Hugo and I wanted to write all the source code myself. Consider my style as a unofficial *fork* of Goa.

**Real web developers, go away! There's nothing fancy for you here.**
